## Recursive song: Sierpinski's Synthphony
This song demonstrates recursion because it is a musical representation of Sierpinski's Triangle, a three-way recursive algorithms. Each time a triangle is created (represented by three sets of two beats), the function recursively calls itself to create three more triangles within it.
